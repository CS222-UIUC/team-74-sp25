# Skincare Product Query Project 

## Description

This application is a quiz designed to recommend effective skincare products to people that are new to skincare or not sure what to buy.

Not too many apps are designed for directly addressing the concerns of skincare users, and ChatGPT/other LLM tools might not be as customizable and specific to the userâ€™s skincare needs.

Our app focuses on finding skin type/primary skin issues/right products for our users.
